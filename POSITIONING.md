# AJT Positioning

AJT is not a product.
It is not a framework.
It is not an enforcement mechanism.

AJT is a specification for recording judgment
at the boundary where execution becomes allowed.

It exists so responsibility can be proven,
not inferred.

This repository defines the concept,
not the implementation.
